## Using the feature request tracker

The [feature request tracker](https://github.com/SocialEngine/phpv4-feature-requests) is
the preferred channel for [feature requests](#features) 
but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** use the feature request tracker for personal support requests (use the [SocialEngine Community](https://community.onsocialengine.com/hot),
  [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/socialengine)
  or other channels).

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

## Feature requests

A feature is a _new function_ that is implemented in the code you download
from SocialEngine.

Feature requests are welcome, but take a moment to find out whether your idea
fits within the scope and aims of SocialEngine. It's up to *you* to make a strong
case to convince the SocialEngine developers of the merits of this feature. Please
provide as much detail and context as possible.

A good feature helps a multitude of people with the least negative impacts on the SocialEngine script.

Guidelines for feature requests:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the feature has already been
   requested.

2. **Check if the feature has been addedd** &mdash; double check for the feature in the
   latest version of software.

3. **Fully describe the feature** &mdash; Give detailed descriptions of what this feature does. Ideally, create screenshots so we can visually see what you are requesting when possible.

4. **One request per issue** &mdash; for better clarity, include only one feature per issue opened.    

A good feature request shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more
information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your request. What module or area is this for (feed, blog, albums, mail, etc)? What do you wish to achieve with this feature? What are the benefits? Why should we consider adding this feature? Does this feature require specific settings?

Example:

> Short and descriptive example feature request title
>
> A summary of the feature request. 
>
> Details of settings, steps to use or see this feature, benefits.
>
> Add screenshots when possible.
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the feature being
> requested. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as
> needing improvements and potential solutions (and your opinions on their
> merits).

Here's a sample of a feature request:

>Title: Networks - Add Privacy Settings Per Network
>
>Description: Networks are great but we need an improvement to them. Currently, when adding content (such as a blog), we can >set privacy for Friends and Networks. That's great but sometimes, we need to share only to a specific Network. This request >is to add a privacy setting to choose a network when sharing content.
>
>* this is where we would see a screenshot for the feature
>
>This would benefit a great deal of clients as they could allow for more privacy filters. Privacy today is a top concern >amongst webmasters.
>
>Thanks for considering my request!
